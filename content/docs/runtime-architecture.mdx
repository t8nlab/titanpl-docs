## 🌌 Introducing Gravity

**Gravity** is the core force that holds the entire TitanPL system together. 

Gravity is the strictly synchronous V8 runtime engine that powers Titan Planet. It represents a fundamental departure from traditional JavaScript runtimes. While Node.js, Bun, and Deno rely on event loops for concurrency, Gravity achieves massive parallelism through **native multi-threading** and **synchronous execution**.

Think of Gravity as the gravitational force in the Titan ecosystem:
- It **binds** your JavaScript code to native Rust performance
- It **grounds** execution in predictable, deterministic patterns
- It **pulls** everything together with zero lock contention

---

## 🧱 What Titan Planet Is Not

Titan Planet is **not a Node.js framework**. It is fundamentally different.

Titan Planet is a **complete high-performance framework** designed for modern backends. It unifies the **Orbit System** for O(1) routing, a powerful **Extension System**, and the **TitanPL SDK** into a cohesive platform. 

It leverages **Gravity Runtime**, a strictly synchronous, multi-threaded Rust+V8 runtime, to execute JavaScript actions.

<Callout type="info">
  Unlike Node.js, Bun, or Deno, **Gravity Runtime** does not run an event loop. Code executes synchronously from request entry to response exit — making execution deterministic, predictable, and exceptionally fast for compute-bound workloads.
</Callout>

## 🎯 Key Architectural Principles

### 1. No Event Loop in Workers

Unlike Node.js which uses libuv's event loop, or Deno/Bun which use Tokio's async runtime, **Gravity workers execute synchronously**.

- **No event queue**
- **No microtask queue**
- **No async callbacks**
- **No `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, or `Promise` chains**

### 2. Request-Driven Execution

Each worker processes one request at a time:

1. Worker receives request from Rust dispatcher
2. Worker blocks and executes the action synchronously
3. Worker returns response
4. Worker awaits next request

**No concurrency within a single worker.** Scaling happens by adding more workers, not through async I/O.

### 3. Blocking I/O

All I/O operations block the worker thread:

```javascript
// ❌ This will NOT work (no async/await support)
export const fetchUser = defineAction(async (req) => {
  const response = await t.fetch("https://api.example.com/user");
  return response;
});

// ✅ Use synchronous blocking calls instead
export const fetchUser = defineAction((req) => {
  // This blocks the worker until the HTTP response arrives
  const response = t.fetch("https://api.example.com/user");
  return response;
});
```

The Rust runtime handles the async I/O under the hood, but to JavaScript, it appears completely synchronous.

### 4. Deterministic Execution

All code runs **linearly**, top to bottom:

- Easier debugging (no callback hell)
- Predictable stack traces
- No race conditions within a single request
- Reproducible behavior

### 5. True Isolation

Each worker owns an **independent V8 isolate** with:

- Zero shared state
- No cross-worker communication
- Isolated heap and garbage collection
- Crash isolation (one worker crash doesn't affect others)

### 6. No `require` or `import.meta`

- **ES6 imports only** (`import`/`export`)
- Dependencies are bundled with esbuild
- No dynamic `require()` at runtime
- No Node.js module resolution

### 7. No Async/Await

JavaScript actions **cannot use**:

- `async`/`await`
- `Promise` chains
- `setTimeout` / `setInterval`
- `process.nextTick`
- Any other asynchronous primitives

## 🔄 Synchronous Execution Model

Here's how a request flows through Gravity:

### Step-by-Step Breakdown

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

└─────────────────────┬───────────────────────────────────────────┘
                      │
                      ▼
         ┌────────────────────────┐
         │   Axum HTTP Server     │

    │  │  │  (JavaScript/TS)     │  │  │
    │  │  │                      │  │  │
    │  │  │  t.fetch() ──────────┼──┼──┼──► Blocks until HTTP response
    │  │  │         │            │  │  │
    │  │  │         ▼            │  │  │
    │  │  │  return { ... }      │  │  │
    │  │  └──────────────────────┘  │  │
    │  └────────────────────────────┘  │
    └──────────┬───────────────────────┘
               │
               │ Return response
               ▼
    ┌─────────────────────────┐
    │   HTTP Response Sent    │
    └─────────────────────────┘
```

**Key Points:**

- The Rust Axum server is async (for network I/O efficiency)
- Each worker executes JavaScript **synchronously**
- Blocking calls (like `t.fetch()`) pause the worker until complete
- The worker returns a response and becomes available for the next request

## 🚀 Multi-Threaded Architecture

Gravity achieves massive concurrency through **native multi-threading**, not async I/O.

![Multi-Threaded Architecture](/multi_threaded_architecture.png)

### How It Works

Gravity spins up a **worker pool**, where each worker owns:

- **Its own V8 isolate** (completely independent JavaScript runtime)
- **Its own context** (global scope, compiled actions)
- **Its own compiled actions** (pre-compiled bytecode)
- **No event loop** (synchronous execution only)

Workers **never share locks**, **never block each other**, and **never wait for global state**.

### Concurrency Model

```
HTTP Requests → Rust Load Balancer → Workers (parallel execution)
                                      ├─ Worker 1 (V8 Isolate, Context, Actions)
                                      ├─ Worker 2 (V8 Isolate, Context, Actions)
                                      ├─ Worker 3 (V8 Isolate, Context, Actions)
                                      └─ Worker N (V8 Isolate, Context, Actions)
```

**Each CPU core runs JavaScript independently:**

- Zero lock contention
- Linear scaling with core count
- Massive throughput under real traffic
- No "Stop-the-World" garbage collection across workers

### Configuring Worker Threads

You can control the number of worker threads directly in your application entry point (`app/app.js`) using the `t.start` function.

```javascript
// Start server on port 3000, log message, and spawn 12 worker threads
t.start(3000, "Titan Running!", 12);
```

**Parameters:**

1. **Port**: The port number to listen on (e.g., `3000`).
2. **Message**: A startup message to log to the console.
3. **Thread Count** (Optional): The specific number of worker threads to spawn.

**Default Behavior:**

If the **Thread Count** argument is omitted, Gravity automatically calculates the thread count based on your hardware:

> **Default Threads = CPU Core Count * 4**

**Example:**
If you have **16 CPU cores** and do not specify a thread count, Gravity will spawn **64 worker threads**.

## 🆚 Gravity vs. Node.js

![Gravity vs Node.js](/gravity_vs_nodejs.png)

| Feature | Node.js Runtime | Gravity Runtime |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Execution Model** | Event Loop (libuv) | Synchronous Workers |
| **Concurrency** | Async I/O (Single Main Thread) | Native Multi-threading |
| **Scaling** | Vertical (limited by event loop) | Linear (scales with cores) |
| **Memory** | Shared Heap (GC blocks all) | Isolated Heap per Worker |
| **CPU Utilization** | Single-core bottleneck | Full Hardware Utilization |
| **Async/Await** | ✅ Required for I/O | ❌ Not Supported |
| **Promises** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| **Event Loop** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |

### Node.js Runtime

**Strengths:**
- Excellent for I/O-heavy workloads
- Non-blocking async operations
- Rich ecosystem of async libraries

**Limitations:**
- Single-threaded execution for user code
- Event loop can become bottleneck
- Async overhead for CPU-bound tasks

### Gravity Runtime

**Strengths:**
- True multi-threaded JavaScript execution
- Linear scaling with CPU cores
- Deterministic, predictable execution
- No async overhead

**Limitations:**
- Cannot use async/await or Promises
- Not ideal for I/O-heavy services with high concurrency
- Requires more workers to scale (trades memory for performance)

---

## ⚡ When to Use Gravity

### ✅ Perfect For

- **CPU-bound or compute-heavy services**
  - AI/ML inference
  - Data transformations
  - Complex business logic
  - Cryptography

- **Deterministic execution requirements**
  - Financial calculations
  - Gaming backends with tick-based logic
  - Reproducible computations

- **Linear debugging workflows**
  - Simple stack traces
  - No callback hell
  - Predictable execution order

- **Predictable memory usage per worker**
  - Isolated heaps
  - No shared state management

- **Crash isolation**
  - One worker crash doesn't affect others
  - Easy recovery and error handling

### ❌ Not Ideal For

- **I/O-heavy services with high concurrency**
  - Use Node.js, Deno, or Bun instead
  - Async I/O is more efficient for these workloads

- **Applications requiring `setTimeout`, Promises, or async/await**
  - Gravity does not support async primitives

- **Real-time event-driven architectures**
  - Event loops are better suited for this

---

## 🔧 Migration from Async Patterns

If you're coming from Node.js, **do not** try to use async patterns.

### ❌ This Will NOT Work

```javascript
export const processData = defineAction(async (req) => {
  const data = await fetchFromDatabase();
  const result = await processWithAI(data);
  return { result };
});
```

### ✅ Use Synchronous Blocking Calls

```javascript
export const processData = defineAction((req) => {
  // These calls block until complete
  const data = t.db.query("SELECT * FROM users");
  const result = processWithAI(data); // Synchronous function
  return { result };
});
```

### Chaining Operations

Instead of Promise chains:

```javascript
// ❌ Node.js style
const result = await fetch(url1)
  .then(res => res.json())
  .then(data => fetch(url2, { body: data }))
  .then(res => res.json());

// ✅ Gravity style
const res1 = t.fetch(url1);
const data = JSON.parse(res1.body);
const res2 = t.fetch(url2, { body: JSON.stringify(data) });
const result = JSON.parse(res2.body);
```

## 🎯 Why Multi-Threading Matters

Traditional JavaScript runtimes:

- Run user code on **one thread**
- Rely heavily on **async I/O** to "fake" concurrency
- Collapse under CPU-heavy workloads

**Gravity eliminates this limitation:**

### Every worker can execute CPU-bound JavaScript simultaneously — **zero blocking**.

This is ideal for:

- 🤖 **AI Systems** — Parallel processing of heavy logic and data
- 🎮 **Gaming Backends** — Low-latency, real-time state synchronization
- 📈 **Real-time Analytics** — High-frequency data transformations
- ⚡ **Compute-heavy Actions** — Multi-user concurrency without blocking

## 🌌 Gravity: The Future of JavaScript Backend Engines

With native Rust + V8 multi-threading, Gravity becomes:

- **Faster** for CPU-bound workloads
- **More scalable** under load
- **Safer and more predictable**
- **Architecturally modern**
- **Ready for enterprise-grade traffic**
