## Update to the latest version

Keeping Titan up to date involves **two simple steps**:

import { Step, Steps } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/steps';

<Steps>
  <Step title="Update the Titan CLI">
    Update the global Titan CLI to the latest version:

    ```bash
    npm install -g @ezetgalaxy/titan@latest
    ```

    This ensures you are using the newest commands, bundlers, and tooling.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Update your Titan project">
    Inside your Titan project directory, run:

    ```bash
    titan update
    ```

    The `titan update` command will:

    - Update internal Titan files
    - Add newly introduced features
    - Apply required migrations automatically
    - Keep your existing app code intact

    You do **not** need to recreate your project.
  </Step>
</Steps>



## When should you run `titan update`?

- After installing a new Titan CLI version
- When new framework features are released
- If the docs mention an update step

> **Tip**  
> Always update the CLI first, then run `titan update` inside your project.
