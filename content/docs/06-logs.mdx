title: Titan Logs
description: Understand Titan’s structured terminal logs during development and runtime.
---

## Overview

Titan provides **structured, readable terminal logs** that reflect what is happening inside the native Rust server at runtime.  
These logs are designed to help you understand routing, action execution, performance, and request flow—without noise.

Titan logs are emitted directly by the Rust server and the JavaScript runtime layer.

---

## Server startup logs

When you run Titan in development mode, the server prints startup information to the terminal.

```bash
  Titan server running at: http://localhost:5000
```

This confirms that:

* The Rust server compiled successfully
* Routes and actions were loaded
* The HTTP server is listening and ready

---

## Build and bundling logs

During development, Titan automatically bundles actions and regenerates metadata when files change.

```bash
  Titan Planet   v26.9.0   [ Dev Mode ]

  Type:        Rust + JS Actions
  Hot Reload:  Enabled

  • Preparing runtime... Done
  • A new orbit is ready for your app in 0.9s
  • Your app is now orbiting Titan Planet

```

These logs indicate:

* JavaScript actions are bundled into `.jsbundle` files
* Routing metadata is regenerated
* The Rust server is aware of the latest application state

---

## Automatic server restarts

When routes or actions change, Titan restarts the Rust server automatically.


```bash
[Titan] Restarting Rust server...
[Titan] Rust server exited: 1
Running target/debug/server.exe
```

This ensures:

* No manual restarts are required
* The running server always reflects current code
* Development feedback is fast and deterministic

---

## 🛡️ Strict Type Safety Errors

Titan prioritizes code quality by enforcing **Strict TypeScript** (Beta) logic during development.
If `titan dev` detects a type error, the server **will not run**. This ensures you never ship or test broken code.

### Sample Error Output
When a type error occurs, Titan pauses execution and provides a clear, actionable log:

```bash
[Titan] ❌ TypeScript Error:
app/actions/payment.ts(12,5): error TS2322: Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'.

    10 |    const amount: number = req.body.amount;
    11 |    
  > 12 |    processPayment( "100" ); // Error here
       |    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

[Titan] 🛑 Server paused due to type errors. Fix them to resume.
```

Once fixed, the server automatically resumes.

---

## Request execution logs

For every incoming request, Titan logs a concise execution summary.

```bash
[Titan] GET /hii → hii (dynamic) in 7.70ms
```

This log shows:

* HTTP method (`GET`)
* Request path (`/hii`)
* Action name (`hii`)
* Route type (`dynamic`)
* Execution time (`7.70ms`)

This makes it easy to track performance and behavior per request.

---

## Action-level logs (`t.log`)

Inside actions, you can emit logs using `t.log()`.

```js
t.log(req)
```

These logs appear in the terminal as structured output:

```bash
[Titan] log(hii): {
  body: null,
  method: "GET",
  path: "/hii",
  params: {},
  query: {},
  headers: {}
}
```

This is useful for:

* Debugging request data
* Inspecting parameters and queries
* Tracing action execution

Unlike `console.log`, `t.log` is routed through Titan’s logging system and remains consistent across environments.

---

## Error logs

When an action throws an error or fails during execution, Titan logs a structured **error summary** in the terminal.  
This allows you to quickly identify *what failed*, *where it failed*, and *how long the request ran before failing*.

```bash
[Titan] GET / → error in 13.51ms
Action: hii
ReferenceError: var is not defined
````

### What this log means

* `GET /`
  The incoming HTTP request and path.

* `→ error`
  Indicates the request failed during execution.

* `13.51ms`
  Total time spent before the error occurred.

* `Action: hii`
  The action responsible for handling the request.

* `ReferenceError: var is not defined`
  The JavaScript runtime error thrown inside the action.

---

### When this log appears

Titan emits this log when:

* An action throws a runtime error
* Invalid JavaScript is executed
* A required variable or reference is missing
* A runtime API call fails and propagates an error

Errors are surfaced immediately and are never swallowed silently.

---

### Why Titan logs errors this way

* Keeps error output concise and readable
* Clearly links the failure to a specific action
* Avoids noisy stack traces by default
* Preserves request timing for debugging performance issues

This makes debugging fast without overwhelming the terminal.

---

### Recommended debugging flow

1. Check the **action name** in the error log
2. Open the corresponding file in `app/actions`
3. Fix the runtime error
4. Save the file — Titan will rebuild and restart automatically

Manual restart is required sometimes for error.

> Errors are part of execution, not framework failure.
> Titan logs them clearly so you can fix them quickly.


## What Titan logs by default

Titan logs the following automatically:

* Server startup and shutdown
* Action bundling and rebuilds
* Route execution summaries
* Execution time per request
* Explicit logs via `t.log()`

There is no silent failure—important events are always visible.

---

## What Titan does not log

By design, Titan avoids:

* Verbose framework noise
* Internal Rust stack traces (unless fatal)
* Unstructured debug spam

This keeps terminal output readable even at scale.

---

## Mental model

> Titan logs reflect **real execution**, not framework abstraction.
> If you see it in the terminal, it happened in the Rust server.

These logs are safe to rely on for development, debugging, and early production observability.
