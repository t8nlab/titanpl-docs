description: The developer toolkit for Titan Planet with type safety and IntelliSense.

---

**Titan SDK** is a development-only toolkit designed to bridge the gap between your local coding environment and the native Titan Planet binary.

> **Note:** The actual implementation of `t.log`, `t.fetch`, and other APIs are embedded directly into the Titan Planet Binary. This SDK simply provides the "blueprints" (types) and a "sandbox" (test runner).

---

## ✨ Features

- **💎 Blueprint Types (IntelliSense)**: Provides the full TypeScript `index.d.ts` for the global `t` object so you get autocomplete in VS Code and other editors.
- **🛡️ Static Validation**: Catch parameter mismatches and typos in `t.log`, `t.fetch`, `t.db`, etc., during development.
- **🔌 Extension Test Harness**: A "lite" version of the Titan runtime that simulates the native environment to test extensions in isolation.
- **🚀 Zero Production Trace**: This is a `devDependencies` package. It never ships with your binary, keeping your production footprint at literal zero.

## 🚀 The Test Harness (Lite Runtime)

The SDK includes a specialized **Test Runner**. This is a "lite" version of the Titan ecosystem that acts as a bridge for developers.

### How it works:
When you run the SDK in an extension folder, it:
1.  **Scaffolds a Virtual Project**: Creates a temporary, minimal Titan environment in `.titan_test_run`.
2.  **Native Compilation**: Automatically builds your native Rust code (`native/`) if it exists.
3.  **Hot-Linking**: Junctions your local extension into the virtual project's `node_modules`.
4.  **Verification**: Generates a test suite that attempts to call your extension's methods via the real `t` object inside the sandbox.

### Usage:

```bash
# Inside your extension directory
titan run ext
```

## ⌨️ Enabling IntelliSense

Since the `t` object is injected globally by the Titan engine at runtime, your IDE won't recognize it by default. The SDK fixes this.

1.  **Install the SDK**:
    ```bash
    npm install --save-dev titanpl-sdk
    ```

2.  **Configure Types**:
    Create or update `jsconfig.json` (or `tsconfig.json`) in your project root:
    ```json
    {
      "compilerOptions": {
        "types": ["titan-sdk"]
      }
    }
    ```

Now your editor will treat `t` as a first-class citizen:
```js
export function myAction(req) {
  t.log.info("Request received", req.path); // Autocomplete works!
  return { status: "ok" };
}
```
